# What's Reflection ?

This is also an Udacity thing, they say the key to learning is to have a growth mindset.
So every time you learn something new, stop and take a moment to reflect on what you learned, what problems you had
and a summary on how to solve it and areas to pay attention in future learning.

## What I learn during this coding test

+ Conceptual understanding of RSS and RSS reader
+ Google has a open-sourced API that helps to parse XML format feeds to JSON format
+ First time writing Jasmine before I write any JS code. (I used jasmine in an Udacity project, but the code was already there, we just need to write testing cases)
+ A little trick to hide value when input box is not '''onfocus'''

## Problem I run into
+ Jasmine async request testing does not work, I think it has to do with this Google API I use
+ When I add '''eventlisterner''' using the standard way, it does not work, so I mix html with js code, it's bad I know
+ The first version of feed reader has a bug, the '''@username''' is not displaying correctly, but it's now fixed in this second version
+ So sometimes my newly added function in main.js don't run, I think it's because too many js file loading makes the code messy and unexpected things happen

## Things to pay attention to
+ Learn code organization! Learn code organization! learn Code organization!
+ Don't write spaghetti code! Don't write spaghetti code! Don't write spaghetti code!

## Summary
The feed reader is functioning, but the code is not so well organized, I bet it's gonna be a headache if requirement changes or new functions
need to be added, this is an area I need to work on.
